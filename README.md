This project is simply giving an example of how to load an unsigned driver from memory using "KDMAPPER" and is easy to learn from.

This is for educational and research purposes only, please do not try to sell this.. the driver on the source is just 
some leaked one and its not going to work on games like fortnite etc for over 30min.

# Project Updates
- ⭐ 5 Stars - I will add keyauth and a proper console menu
- ⭐ 10 Stars - I will add a better driver, cleaner, etc
- ⭐ 15 Stars - I will add a perm spoofing option to this and maybe add an imgui menu
# There will be more to come if i see interest in this.
