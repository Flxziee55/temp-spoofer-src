# temp-spoofer-src

This project is simply giving an example of how to load an unsigned driver from memory using "KDMAPPER".

This is for educational and research purposes only, please do not try to sell this.. the driver on the source is just 
some leaked one and its not going to work on games like fortnite etc for over 30min.
